Objectives:

-   Item 1

## Is this course for you? {#sec-is-it-for-you}

To help manage expectations and develop the material for this course, we
make a few assumptions about *who you are* as a participant in the
course:

-   You want to work more effectively within a team-based setting on a
    common set of files
-   You have a desire to work together in a more open and transparent
    way in your team(s)

While we have these assumptions to help focus the content of the course,
if you have an interest in learning what we teach but don't fit any of the above
assumptions, *you are still welcome to attend the course*! We welcome
everyone, that is until the course capacity is reached.

In addition to the assumptions, we also have a fairly focused scope for
teaching and expectations for learning. So this may also help you decide
if this course is for you.
