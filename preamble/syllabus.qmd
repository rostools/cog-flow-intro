## Is this course for you? {#sec-is-it-for-you}

To help manage expectations and develop the material for this course, we
make a few assumptions about *who you are* as a participant in the
course:

-   Assumptions

While we have these assumptions to help focus the content of the course,
if you have an interest in learning R but don't fit any of the above
assumptions, *you are still welcome to attend the course*! We welcome
everyone, that is until the course capacity is reached.

In addition to the assumptions, we also have a fairly focused scope for
teaching and expectations for learning. So this may also help you decide
if this course is for you.
