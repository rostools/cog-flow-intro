## Learning objectives

This sessionâ€™s **overall learning outcome** is to enable you to:

1.  Create and configure a GitHub repository for a team-based project.

**Specific objectives** are to:

1.  Create a new public **repository** on GitHub to serve as the
    foundation for a team-based project.
2.  Select and apply an appropriate **license** to the repository to
    establish usage rights.
3.  Configure **branch protection rules** for the `main` branch of the
    repository to enforce code quality and security standards.
4.  Define who are "responsible" for the project by adding **code
    owners**
5.  **Clone** the repository to create a local copy on your computer to
    work on the project.
