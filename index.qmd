# Welcome!

BACKGROUND: CHALLENGE

BACKGROUND: NEED

This course is designed to address these issues. We use a variety of
learning activities like code-along sessions (instructor and learner
coding together), reading activities, discussions, a few presentations,
hands-on exercises, as well as a final group project. This website
contains all of the material for the course, from reading material to
exercises to images. It is structured as a book, with "chapters" as
lessons, given in order of appearance. We make heavy use of the website
throughout the course where code-along sessions follow the material on
the website nearly exactly (with slight modifications for time or more
detailed explanations).

The course material was created using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) to
write the lessons and create the book format,
[GitHub](https://github.com/) to host the [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
repository of the material, and [GitHub
Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) with
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to create and host the website. The
original source material for this course is found on the
[`git4cats`](https://github.com/rostools/git4cats) GitHub
repository.
